Also, visual strain is complicated by lighting at night and also \nof the headlights of the vehicles (Kartekeyian et al. 2004).\n  Ear problem was found among 84 per cent respondents. This is due to noise of vehicles, horns, etc., \nwhich they are exposed to for long hours. If such conditions exist for long then they may result in partial \nor total hearing loss. Vehicular traffic is a major source of noise (Gupta & Mahapatra 2003). Glare from \nsunlight may result in eye-strain. Noise can be a source of annoyance, distraction and fatigue. It may \ninterfere with the driver\u2019s ability to concentrate or get auditory signal from the traffic on the road.\n The result reveals that 60 per cent of the respondents suffer from sleeping problems. Long hours of \nwork, stay away from home, irregular food habits, all of these lead to the problem. This can cause dis-\nruption and result in a major accident also. Bus drivers frequently report tension, mental overload, fatigue \nand sleeping problems. Fatigue for drivers is usually apparent \u2018when an individual cannot meet self-\nimposed or externally imposed performance goals but is forced to continue working under adverse con-\nditions by a sense of duty and/or the need to safeguard the lives of others\u2019 (Brown 1994, p. 299). \nAccording to Brown, four main mechanisms hinder attainment of goals for drivers. \n There may be temperature problems in the bus, excessive heat in the summer or poor heating and \nblasts of cold air in the winter. Bus drivers breathe in vehicle exhaust when readying the bus for service, \nfrom their own bus engine, and from surrounding traffic. Bus drivers are exposed to communicable dis-\neases such as the common cold from the public (Evans et al. 1991).\nConclusion\nThe study is based on perception of the health problems as encountered by the respondents (drivers and \nconductors) and medical inference may be needed. But however, these are probabilities which cannot be \ndenied: that the problems suffered by the bus drivers and conductors may be attributed to the nature of \nwork they are exposed to and the associated life-style which is an outcome of their occupation. The \nexposure to air and noise pollution, posture and position of their working condition, irregular food habits \nand other habits like smoking\u2019 etc. arise out of the occupation. A continuous stress and problems related \nto hysterical and inappropriate traffic regulations and management puts them to further risks of fatigue \nand tension. This deterioration is largely the result of traffic congestion and its associated air and noise \npollution but also with the pressures of maintaining a demanding schedule in circumstances that make \nthat task almost impossible. Stress and musculo-skeletal problems are not the only problems bus drivers \nface. \nResearch supports a number of actions to reduce work hazards, which include reduction of traffic \ncongestion, reduction of fatigue and interference with personal life (improving work schedules) improv-\ning ergonomic design of buses (seat design, steering wheel design, etc.) and a little more comfortable \nspace for movement for the conductors inside the bus.\n at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 19, 2016jhm.sagepub.comDownloaded from ", "path": null, "url": null, "mimetype": null}, "image_resource": null, "audio_resource": null, "video_resource": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "Document", "text": "A Study of Bus Drivers 205\nJournal of Health Management, 14, 2 (2012): 201\u2013206\n The nervous system problem occurs as the drivers have to sit and concentrate in one direction\u2014the \ndirection of the road in moving condition. \nThis puts them to a temporary state of hypnotism. The conse-\nquences are depression, fatigue, tremors in hands and legs, etc.\n  The problem of eyes (84 per cent) among the respondents can be attributed to the dust, smoke, etc. \nwhich result in reddening of eyes, burning sensation, prickling, watering, etc. The strain increases, as \nthey have to strain their eyes on the road. Also, visual strain is complicated by lighting at night and also \nof the headlights of the vehicles (Kartekeyian et al. 2004).\n  Ear problem was found among 84 per cent respondents. This is due to noise of vehicles, horns, etc., \nwhich they are exposed to for long hours. If such conditions exist for long then they may result in partial \nor total hearing loss. Vehicular traffic is a major source of noise (Gupta & Mahapatra 2003). Glare from \nsunlight may result in eye-strain. Noise can be a source of annoyance, distraction and fatigue. It may \ninterfere with the driver\u2019s ability to concentrate or get auditory signal from the traffic on the road.\n The result reveals that 60 per cent of the respondents suffer from sleeping problems.
